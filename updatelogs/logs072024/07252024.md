# 7/25/2024 - 4th Update

(he, infact, did not wake up earlier)

ok, plans for today: UI, start reworking rendering system

ill brb, i need to win quizizz... i was second, dang it! anyways, resuming coding! ok, made a little mock up of the UI:

ok, so there should be two canvases, one for drawing and one for tools and stuff. time to measure stuff! unfrotunately, i have to do this exactly and nicely or else my ocd brain will not let me sleep at night. ok boxes laid out, time to write down the coordinates

ok, done!

im back, guess who did all the slide design and created all the slides for a GROUP project? (i did waste an hour drawing. not in protoplop. which is unironically ironic) back to measuring!

area sizes: (x,y)

- drawing area: (1024, 658)
- tools area: (288, 179)
- color picker area: (288, 155)
- layers area: (288, 298)

are we gonna make 4 canvas or 2? my rng (aka family member) chose 4. (i just asked 2 or 4, this may be a smart or not smart move)

note: this is not Tape, but im still using Tape resources because i haven't made any for Protoplop just yet. however, we are able to run this smoothly at around 11 to 13 FPS! it looks like the background is some sort of frame now!

ok, time to go to interface.py with a sledgehammer again. hmm i definetly broke something. only the last thing is rendering, and whatever that clipping issue is. (the first issue was before the sledgehammer) hey, its fixed! seems to be because of the garbage collector, fixed with a cache of sorts. ok, we should plan out a couple days now:

- 7/26/2024 - make UI prettier and themed
- 7/27/2024 - prepare visual interactable objects, start tools logic
- 7/28/2024 - start work on canvas/drawing area/sketch
- 7/29/2024 - more work
- 7/30/2024 - work on that pop up data menu
- 7/31/2024 - work on color picker
-  8/1/2024 - possible prerelease???
-  8/2/2024 - work on layers
-  8/3/2024 - additional features
-  8/4/2024 - additional features
-  8/5/2024 - polish up
