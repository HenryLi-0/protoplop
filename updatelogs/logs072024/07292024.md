# 7/29/2024 - 8th Update!

hello, i had quite a dream last night, but i forgot it. oops. however, it did leave a song stuck in my head that ive never heard of before.

> (from 7/28/2024:) ... next step is to FIX ZOOM and get moving going, then start the actual painting logic i guess? also, it appears that zooming in more and more increases distortion on one axis...

~~"There's no feeling more intense than starting over."~~ yeah, im gonna rewrite it... also, why is my pencil melting in my hands?

ok, adding the code in now! (sledgehammer time again) encountering some issues with the lambdas???

ok sketchzoom does nothing now oops. ok, offsetting is working correctly (its now centered!) but zooming is not...

ok, zooming is working, but the image is distorted

ok, its working! now, zoom centering by affecting camera pos time!

control + space + mouse movement seems to be working?

ok, zooming in isn't exactly working as i want it to, but its ok, as it might not make it to the final version (control + space + mouse movement is more "exact")

time to bring back the optimizations now, but not before a quick commit!

YES! THE ZOOMING IN OPTIMZATION IS WORKIGN!!!
