# 7/29/2024 - 8th Update!

hello, i had quite a dream last night, but i forgot it. oops. however, it did leave a song stuck in my head that ive never heard of before.

> (from 7/28/2024:) ... next step is to FIX ZOOM and get moving going, then start the actual painting logic i guess? also, it appears that zooming in more and more increases distortion on one axis...

~~"There's no feeling more intense than starting over."~~ yeah, im gonna rewrite it... also, why is my pencil melting in my hands?

ok, adding the code in now! (sledgehammer time again) encountering some issues with the lambdas???

ok sketchzoom does nothing now oops. ok, offsetting is working correctly (its now centered!) but zooming is not...

ok, zooming is working, but the image is distorted

ok, its working! now, zoom centering by affecting camera pos time!

control + space + mouse movement seems to be working?

ok, zooming in isn't exactly working as i want it to, but its ok, as it might not make it to the final version (control + space + mouse movement is more "exact")

time to bring back the optimizations now, but not before a quick commit!

YES! THE ZOOMING IN OPTIMZATION IS WORKIGN!!!

ok, oops, fell asleep, gonna start basic layers logic and then maybe simple drawing? i have one hour until i have to go outside and take the train somewhere, so i better get coding!

ok here's the layers logic, every layer has to be in order, probably as in order in a list, index 0 is bottom, index 999 is top (not actually 999, but you know, the last one). so, every layer has an above and a below, even the ending ones (below the index 0 is a transparent grid, above index 999 is, well, another transparent grid). so, we should have 3 cacluated layers at all times, the sum of all visible layers below, the sum of all visible layers on top, and the current one. the easiest way would be to grab all the data and smack is right on top, but we already have an optimization, `getRegion()`. so, when we change layers, we `grabRegion()` do a little cacluating and get a precalculated "all layers below" and "all layers on top" and prepare for edits to be made to the active layer.

ok, basic logic is there, but doesn't appear to work, but i have to go now, so im gonna commit!

ok, im back, is 9:21 PM... contiung work on layer things! ok, the issue was the strange ways that `placeOver()` deals with transparency, but its not really ideal to fix it right now, so gonna move on for now, because i just remembered something i realized! we were going from mouse -> zoomed image position, but camera pos is based on the non zoomed image!

ok, its working now, but its not simplified!
```
(x - 512 + (self.cameraPos[0] * self.sketchZoom/100))/(self.sketchZoom/100)
((x - 512)/(self.sketchZoom/100)) + self.cameraPos[0]
```

ok, centering focus is now working! currently fixing `placeOver()` transparency behavior... it should be good now?

i was gonna work on sketch_quality, where you can decrease the quality of the screen but oops undid the code thinking it wasnt neccesary, then realized its porbably a good idea to have it, but i undid it, so time to redo it

fixed an issue where it is trying to render something 100x the quality of the screen, ok, here's quality 10! (1 is the best quality)
