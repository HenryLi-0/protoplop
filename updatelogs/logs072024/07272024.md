# 7/27/2024 - 6th Update!

oops did not get up early (slept in a little) however, it is saturday, so i dont have much on my schedule for once!

tasks:

- 7/26/2024 DONE - make UI prettier and themed
- 7/27/2024 - prepare visual interactable objects, start tools logic
- 7/28/2024 - start work on canvas/drawing area/sketch logic

its probably smarter to actual start on canvas logic first before tools, since what are you gonna draw on?

oops accidentally let go of my mouse and it went flying

ok zoom is working but not exactly how i want it to work. realized that the code does not support multi-key keybinds (ex. control+space), fixing that now!

ok, improved the logic for key presses and detection, multiple key keybinds are possible now!
