# 7/28/2024 - 7th Update!

oops did not get up early (i woke up to an alarm, turned it off, and continued sleeping, 4 times with 10 minutes in between!)

today appears to be about continuing work on the sketch screen math and logic stuff, so time to get coding!

the fomula for translating relative mouse position to the real target area seems to be `pCalc = lambda p: round(p*100/self.sketchZoomMulScaled)`

so the inverse would be target area to realtive screen position, and it would be 

```
x = p*100/self.sketchZoomMulScaled
p = x*self.sketchZoomMulScaled/100
```

ok, heres a reason we need to optimize! while zooming out we are creating massive blank arrays of transparent pixels, meaning that zooming in is easy, but zooming out creates tons of useless information that gets destoryed anyways

well that was confusing, the next thing we should probably do is to make it eaven faster with a transparent array to be placed on top of, and to only update when neccessary!
