# 7/28/2024 - 7th Update!

oops did not get up early (i woke up to an alarm, turned it off, and continued sleeping, 4 times with 10 minutes in between!)

today appears to be about continuing work on the sketch screen math and logic stuff, so time to get coding!

the fomula for translating relative mouse position to the real target area seems to be `pCalc = lambda p: round(p*100/self.sketchZoomMulScaled)`

so the inverse would be target area to realtive screen position, and it would be 

```
x = p*100/self.sketchZoomMulScaled
p = x*self.sketchZoomMulScaled/100
```

ok, heres a reason we need to optimize! while zooming out we are creating massive blank arrays of transparent pixels, meaning that zooming in is easy, but zooming out creates tons of useless information that gets destoryed anyways

well that was confusing, the next thing we should probably do is to make it eaven faster with a transparent array to be placed on top of, and to only update when neccessary!

ok, wait, we need to add offset too! ok, offset seems to work! ok, it seems to work for real now! now working on centering the screen when using control + space + mouse movement

wait, `self.pCalc()` and `self.iCalc()` don't that camera offset into consideration just yet! ok, finally fixed all that stuff, turns out that affected a lot...

math time:
```
self.pCalc(512) (pixel 512 on screen -> pixel on image) must stay constant even when zoom changes, so

if ((51200/oldz)+self.cameraPos[0]) = ((51200/newz)+self.cameraPos[0])

what is 

self.pCalc(0) = (0*100/self.sketchZoomMulScaled)+self.cameraPos[0]
self.pCalc(0) = self.cameraPos[0]
self.cameraPos[0] = self.pCalc(0)

wait what

change = ((deltax) + (deltay))/10

wait we're just proving 1 = 1 what
```

ok how about this:

```
we are given the center pixel and zoom, calculate the offset

```

ok, i used logic and it seems to kinda work (that is control + space + mouse movement), but scrolling and zooming is sitll a little wonky. also, we have some interesting rendering issues?

hmm...

ok, its 8:23 PM and im back, hopefully i can quickly fix zooming and the distortion? ok, ive tried a lot of things and i have no clue why its still not working, so ill think about it overnight, for now, i should probably move on...

hey, icon visual objects is now a thing!

ok, drew a moving icon! should probably start working on adding icons (and actually drawing) now!
