# 7/30/2024 - 9th Update!

ok, i did not wake up early, i fell asleep trying to turn off my alarm.

> (from 7/29/2024:) work on both drawing and the pop up data menu next! (the second shouldn't be too difficult?)

probably should start the pop up data menu first... ok, optimizations were made, and there is a menu now!

im gonna start working on a slider visual object, ok, "log magic", and wow, im done already! its still a bit buggy, and the text/value display isn't showing yet, but im just gonna commit quickly...
