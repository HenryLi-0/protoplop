# 7/30/2024 - 9th Update!

ok, i did not wake up early, i fell asleep trying to turn off my alarm.

> (from 7/29/2024:) work on both drawing and the pop up data menu next! (the second shouldn't be too difficult?)

probably should start the pop up data menu first... ok, optimizations were made, and there is a menu now!

im gonna start working on a slider visual object, ok, "log magic", and wow, im done already! its still a bit buggy, and the text/value display isn't showing yet, but im just gonna commit quickly...

ok, im back time to work on finishing the slider and maybe start drawing logic? about the slider, its now working as intended! im now working on the popup thing (i forgot to do that before starting drawing logic oops)

i just did a little silly, turns out it was crashing because we never set up the rising change detection correctly

ok, so the popup data thingy works! now, we need to start working on drawing logic! this is good!

ok, i just made a couple images to test the current rendering system, top left is a rainbow of 1x1 pixels, below it is a grid of 2x2 pixels, top right is 1 black, 1 white, 2 black, 2 white, 3 black, 3 white, and so on, and below it is a target-looking thing for control+f accuracy test, and below it is a couple shades of white/grey/gray/black, to test how much the quality affects this (similar purpose to the grids). (the images were only created to test the rendering system, idk if the images/patterns mean anything, but i certainly did not know)

ok, here are some notes! when zooming in, pixels can sometimes look like rectangles/are uneven (as seen with the rainbow grid). other than that, nothing else seems too concerning?
