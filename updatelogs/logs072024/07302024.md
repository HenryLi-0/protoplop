# 7/30/2024 - 9th Update!

ok, i did not wake up early, i fell asleep trying to turn off my alarm.

> (from 7/29/2024:) work on both drawing and the pop up data menu next! (the second shouldn't be too difficult?)

probably should start the pop up data menu first... ok, optimizations were made, and there is a menu now!

im gonna start working on a slider visual object, ok, "log magic", and wow, im done already! its still a bit buggy, and the text/value display isn't showing yet, but im just gonna commit quickly...

ok, im back time to work on finishing the slider and maybe start drawing logic? about the slider, its now working as intended! im now working on the popup thing (i forgot to do that before starting drawing logic oops)

i just did a little silly, turns out it was crashing because we never set up the rising change detection correctly

ok, so the popup data thingy works! now, we need to start working on drawing logic! this is good!

![hey!](</updatelogs/images/072024/07302024 - 1.png>)

ok, i just made a couple images to test the current rendering system, top left is a rainbow of 1x1 pixels, below it is a grid of 2x2 pixels, top right is 1 black, 1 white, 2 black, 2 white, 3 black, 3 white, and so on, and below it is a target-looking thing for control+f accuracy test, and below it is a couple shades of white/grey/gray/black, to test how much the quality affects this (similar purpose to the grids). (the images were only created to test the rendering system, idk if the images/patterns mean anything, but i certainly did not know)

ok, here are some notes! when zooming in, pixels can sometimes look like rectangles/are uneven (as seen with the rainbow grid). other than that, nothing else seems too concerning?

ok, we're back, and its brush/painting/drawing time!

after thinking, i think a brush "imprint" be represented by size of the brush and strength. size is obvious, but strength is like the difference between "solid black, the entire brush's imprint" or "center is solid black, but gets faint the farther out you go"

ok, i think its acting correctly. just a note, i think its a pretty good thing that i should keep doing, but adding small optimizations is really boosting the FPS. i should probably revisit Tape one day and upgrade it with some optimizations...

now for the scary part, adding drawing! ok fixed an issue entering and exiting the state of drawing. ok, wrote a sloppy first version, here we go!

as expected, it didnt work... as expected, it may have been a silly mistake...

yay, first drawing! ~~uh that kind of looks like very dehydrated urine~~

![first drawing!](</updatelogs/images/072024/07302024 - 2.png>)

ok, couple opinions:
- i dont like drawing at 4 FPS
- Red + Green is not orange, it made yellow. oops.
- optimizations are needed!1!111 ahhh
- we need more specific `updateSomething` "requests"
- why are we calculating everything (layers and all) when we are drawing... (similar to previous opinion)

ok, update, its now orange! wait, quick docs!

hey, threw together a quick color picker! gonna quickly commit now!

ok im back, continueing the logic for the paintbrush now! ~~so it doesnt look like a two year olds barf~~

oh look!

now, we need to optimize this... (we get a good 0 FPS while drawing)
