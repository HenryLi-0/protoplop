# 7/22/2024 - 1st Update!

wow, clean new repository...

ok, whats the plan here, what is the vision? the plan is to make a basic digital painting thing. this is a 100% original new idea that has totally never been done before (sarcasm detected). Why is it called what it is? i dont really know. (it may change, but idk)

this time, unlike Tape, we are going to be more ambitious than i should be, lets plan out some stuff! instead of taking 1.5 months, i want to finish this in half or less than half of that time, 2-3 weeks! (i know, very ambitious)

here's the plan for the first couple days:

- 7/22/2024 - plan, copy over Tape files, basic UI design (try to finalize!!!)
- 7/23/2024 - remove unnecessary tape files (only basic UI and code structure is needed)

ok, wasn't able to do much today, but here's a first rough UI design!

so, back to Tape, a large issue that i forgot to (and didn't know how to) solve was the insane lag of large images being placed over other large images. the second (right side) of the image shows a possible idea where the screen is split into smaller segments and are processed only when neccesary. im not sure if this will be neccesary, as the idea im looking to is that "the drawing is the background"

this idea is a bit flawed as "whats behind the drawing?" shows up, but we can just probably do one large overlay and thats that. the idea is basically to have undo and redo be stored in a list that adds and deletes the first one past a certain limit (to, you know, not blow up your memory) and can go back and forth. the idea is to make a bitmap style image editor, since i dont really care about the vector way of drawing with svg and stuff for now. (well, on one hand, it would be easier and cool, but you can't really draw the way i am planning with it)

the background image will exist and when tools are being used, it will be on a temporary layer that will show up as you draw, and will be merged on top of the active drawing layer when the tool/mouse is released. right, so the layers. of course, we will have to overlay them on top of each other, but this is where i HOPE optimized pre-processed stuff can help

anyways, i am feeling a little eepy from a really busy day with things not related to coding, hopefully i remember to copy the Tape files over... (im on github mobile right now) anyways, good night!
