# 7/24/2024 - 3rd Update

ok, so i figured out that the canvas is WICKED FAST. like this image usually grinds the rendering system of Tape to a good 4 FPS, but im at around 15 to 17 FPS. that's insane! however, putting a ~3000x4000 pixel image brings it to 3 to 4 FPS. just tested it with tape, it report 2-ish FPS, but it is visably slower (i can see the tabs switching when i press buttons...). this means that the canvas is likely the way to go, with a couple of my own optimizations

optimizations we can do:
- before shoving images into the renderer, clip off unnecesary bits
- image "chunks" (only update regions when needed)


working on clipping images before they are put into the canvas, hopefully it speeds things up? getting a region is coded but needs to be tested

the solution was way simplier than i thought, i spent way too long trying to make the image move nicely. however, there are improvements! 17-20 FPS! quick save, once second...
