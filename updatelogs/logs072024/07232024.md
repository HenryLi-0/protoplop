anyways, now that im probably sick, that means theres limited time to code today! quick, its coding time!

- 7/22/2024 - plan, copy over Tape files, basic UI design (try to finalize!!!)
- 7/23/2024 - remove unnecessary tape files (only basic UI and code structure is needed)

today, is basically "copy over and clean up Tape in preperation for Protoplop"

ok, files have been copied over, its pruning time!
