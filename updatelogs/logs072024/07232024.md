# 7/23/2024 - 2nd Update!

ok, so idk whether i drank from my bottle of water or my expriment water bottle of glue + borax + too much water (from a chemistry lesson a long time ago). i uh, might have drank a bit from the wrong bottle. (oops)

anyways, now that im probably sick, that means theres limited time to code today! quick, its coding time!

- 7/22/2024 - plan, copy over Tape files, basic UI design (try to finalize!!!)
- 7/23/2024 - remove unnecessary tape files (only basic UI and code structure is needed)

today, is basically "copy over and clean up Tape in preperation for Protoplop"

ok, files have been copied over, its pruning time! we dont need the `tape/tapes/` folder, or the `bay.py` and cache managing stuff. the UI interacting visual objects system will probably stay, sprites aren't needed, pathing isn't needed... pruning away!

so im basically going around my old code with a sledgehammer and saving the things i need (a copy of my old code)

ok, as expected, that bricked everything... time to fix whats left and continue cleaning? ok got it working i think? but now its time to step away from that and think about processing. also, we should use a different color palette for this one

i am having a conversation with the omniscient ai bots right now, ive been told of a tkinter canvas?

playing around with the canvas widget right now, it can have potential

hmm, im gonna have to see which ones faster, but this idea of "chunks" and segmenting the image into smaller units (maybe 64x64 sections?) would be faster? im not sure if the Tape or Canvas way of doing things will be faster...
