# 7/31/2024 - 10th Update!

boy, today's about to be a busy day! (oops i forgor to do a CAD assignment...)

whats today? optimized drawing day!

to prevent my sleep-deprived brain from smashing my head into the keyboard, im gonna get some music and cold water quickly... ok, here we go!

im a moron! i could've been placing the little pop up data menu as its own seperate label! well, actually, turns out its pretty hard to make it transparent... so, i found a solution to this transparency issue, we just banish the label far off the screen!

after being on resolution 3, resolution 1 feels unreal... 

hmm strange behavior...

![huh](</updatelogs/images/072024/07312024 - 1.png>)

it now (accidentally) has a funny loading animation if you restrict how many update regions it process per tick, i guess that will be a setting...

ok, quick commit!
