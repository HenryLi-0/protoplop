# 7/31/2024 - 10th Update!

boy, today's about to be a busy day! (oops i forgor to do a CAD assignment...)

whats today? optimized drawing day!

to prevent my sleep-deprived brain from smashing my head into the keyboard, im gonna get some music and cold water quickly... ok, here we go!

im a moron! i could've been placing the little pop up data menu as its own seperate label! well, actually, turns out its pretty hard to make it transparent... so, i found a solution to this transparency issue, we just banish the label far off the screen!

after being on resolution 3, resolution 1 feels unreal... 

hmm strange behavior...

![huh](</updatelogs/images/072024/07312024 - 1.png>)

it now (accidentally) has a funny loading animation if you restrict how many update regions it process per tick, i guess that will be a setting...

ok, quick commit! now, lets *maybe* start paint optimizations (hopefully)

interesting question, how slow/fast is fetching a region? `1000 tests | 0.002731361389160156s each`

with converting it into an image, we get `1000 tests | 0.002938128471374512s each`

wow... maybe the true cause of speed is placing it on the giant image? (as in each region, grabbing and converting)

ok, i have a goofy idea, lets split up the screen into 48 more little screens, one label per region. wait but first, lets double check this

now testing sketch updating (as in updating the label image) `1000 tests | 0.01781470036506653s each` hmm, maybe smaller images are faster? `1000 tests | 0.0006498446464538575s each` thats like 100x faster, and its just sketch vs oh wait, its transparent... let me fix that real quick... `1000 tests | 0.0005291426181793213s each` for sketch vs layers. wait that was also transparent. the real results are `0.00267251181602478s each`, which is like 8x faster, but seems correct to scale (sketch vs tools)

comparing the ratios, it appears that the canvas is 13x the size of the tools, but is 6x slower than it. going to pixels/second, we get `tools: 19289718.2684` and `sketch: 37822247.1438` this suggests that the big image is good?

after staring into space, i think that it might be better to split it up, because we are unneccesarily updating the entire screen and sending it through the entire updating process when we only need to edit one label
