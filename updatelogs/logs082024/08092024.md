# 8/9/2024 - 19th Update!

ok, just wrote down lore of a series of events that happened around three years ago... that took like 45 minutes... anyways, time to fix masking and OPTIMIZE IT VNOASVNMAPCEMFLM. Also contrary to popular belief, I have a very good VSCode setup. Totally don't have two code windows. *cough cough* i mean three. (its actually pretty cool)

ok, this solution took 3 hours of thinking, i've tried around three or four different solutions and now this last one works! it looks so simple, its 3 lines of code, but i though way too hard on this one! (this took a lot of thinking and time, unfortunately)

ok, optimization time! ~~irrelevant, but i have a meeting going on the side (i dont have to do anything there), and this guy speaking sounds like that one text to speech voice made by videos created by bots that talk about some random conspiracy or play that ominous background music while talking about some random movie summary~~

first optimization, resizing! so i went into the code of `Image.fromarray()`, and realized that it doesnt need a (y,x, 4) array, it even works with a (y,x) array. ok, just modified `addBlank()` and `getRegion()` from `render.py`, it should have support for mask arrays (y,x) instead of (y,x,4) now! best part about a 806 lines file, you know what youre looking for is there, but you cant find it! oh there it is

ok, so the thought process is that we should never calculate every pixel on every layer, since that's a waste of processing! currently, the processed layers (with the layer mask applied) was applied every time somethingw as drawn. this is unnecessary! we only need to apply regions of the mask in regions of the image in regions that we need to update! ok, `self.processedLayers` should be entirely removed now?

ok, optimizations are good, but i defintely broke something... ok problem seems to be coming from setSizeSize()  somehow adding a third dimension to the mask?

oh. oh.

hmm, i wonder why... ok, now somethings broken with zooming out... ok its fixed now! gonna test a couple things...

ok, just got this idea a while ago, but we now have `SKETCH_MAX_REGIONS_TIME`! its a setting that sets the maximum allowed time to spend on region updates per tick! This is just incase anyone loves performance stuff and needs this...

ok, paint bucket, how do we do this? its been a lot of trouble shooting, and after ripping the rendering code out of Tape, we get this: 

it has like no care about tolerance huh?

YES ITS FILLING CORRECTLY! turns out, i forgot to consider the alpha channel in doing the math, oops, but now it works!

woah thats smooth (it takes pretty long irl, idk what optimizations we can make though)

ok, implementing this tommorow, good night!
