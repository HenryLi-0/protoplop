# 8/9/2024 - 19th Update!

ok, just wrote down lore of a series of events that happened around three years ago... that took like 45 minutes... anyways, time to fix masking and OPTIMIZE IT VNOASVNMAPCEMFLM. Also contrary to popular belief, I have a very good VSCode setup. Totally don't have two code windows. *cough cough* i mean three. (its actually pretty cool)

ok, this solution took 3 hours of thinking, i've tried around three or four different solutions and now this last one works! it looks so simple, its 3 lines of code, but i though way too hard on this one! (this took a lot of thinking and time, unfortunately)
