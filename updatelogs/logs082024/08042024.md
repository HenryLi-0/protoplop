> 8/4/2024 - work on layers

ok, time to work on layers! (like the UI and stuff) (not relelvant, but everytime i "contract" the huge functions, the numbers suddenly going up always looks silly)

ok, drew a little thing so i have some idea of the UI

ok, while showering, i realized that we need to add transparency of layers editing, basically, making it easier to modify the transparency layer by making it "drawable". my idea was to basically use the same idea behind the interactable visual object system, but without the IDs as keys. another way to do this is to do the same thing but store the data depending on how a list is ordered, for example, let "x" be a layer and "y" be the layer's transparency. we can have a list like xyxyxyxy or even xyxxxxy where the transparency layers affect the one before it (because, no layer should have more than one?) or, we can make it even easier and just make it [xy,xy,xy] where there is just a list of a list of a layer and its transparency layer. but for now, we'll ignore it!

ok, we have layer moving up and down, but it has made me realized that the layers area is rendering upside down (as in we store layers as bottom -> top, but we render layers top -> bottom, therefore "upper" layers are shown below) here's a commit!

haha! just a couple small changes and: layers are rendering correctly (top = upper layer, bottom = lower layer), and we are editing! also, i finished season 4 of the 2010 sci fi show... waiting to get season 5 from the library! anyways, tommorow will be more layers work, while i'll be super busy in real life (multiple event and errands... oh wow). anyways, good night!
