# 8/12/2024 - 22nd Update!

ok, if done correctly today will be an insane coding day (i have planned 6 hours of coding in my schedule for today, lets see how that goes...) what are we doing today?

> - 8/11/2024 - DONE - more saving and loading work
> - 8/12/2024 - finish things, a couple extra buttons, possible release!

oh right, we need to finish resizing! (just appreciating the 60+ FPS for a second...) also, i think that the text boxes should have a bit of an upgrade (its pretty hard to tell if youre editing them)

its looking a bit fancy...

ok, positioned it, think thats good! now time to make it work! its working! yes, there i do know that there is an issue of typing letters into text boxes and crashing it... (also, it doesnt work the other way yet) ok, that issue has been fixed! 

ok, im back, time to make the resize button resize! (it currently only has funny numbers!) i am currently considering to remake the init function/methoed in order to make it easier to reset? im not sure... probably wont be neccesary for now... ok, `tickButtons()` is now a thing, just for organization! ok, just added another optional parameter to initiating the interface, where layer data can be saved or reset... ok, wrote some code, time to test! so clicking the button doesnt do anything... huh. hey its resizing now! ok, just to test that it hasnt broken the layers system

interesting, we've split the image into two...

ok, will defintely add rendering small images to the list of weird stuff... resizing seems to be working, time to work on finishing the move button stuff! hmm, i think instead of making this be the tool to do scrolling and stuff, i actually make it moving... (like drag the layer to a position on the image) ok, quick commit first!
