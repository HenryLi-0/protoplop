# 8/12/2024 - 22nd Update!

ok, if done correctly today will be an insane coding day (i have planned 6 hours of coding in my schedule for today, lets see how that goes...) what are we doing today?

> - 8/11/2024 - DONE - more saving and loading work
> - 8/12/2024 - finish things, a couple extra buttons, possible release!

oh right, we need to finish resizing! (just appreciating the 60+ FPS for a second...) also, i think that the text boxes should have a bit of an upgrade (its pretty hard to tell if youre editing them)

its looking a bit fancy...

ok, positioned it, think thats good! now time to make it work! its working! yes, there i do know that there is an issue of typing letters into text boxes and crashing it... (also, it doesnt work the other way yet) ok, that issue has been fixed! 

ok, im back, time to make the resize button resize! (it currently only has funny numbers!) i am currently considering to remake the init function/methoed in order to make it easier to reset? im not sure... probably wont be neccesary for now... ok, `tickButtons()` is now a thing, just for organization! ok, just added another optional parameter to initiating the interface, where layer data can be saved or reset... ok, wrote some code, time to test! so clicking the button doesnt do anything... huh. hey its resizing now! ok, just to test that it hasnt broken the layers system

interesting, we've split the image into two...

ok, will defintely add rendering small images to the list of weird stuff... resizing seems to be working, time to work on finishing the move button stuff! hmm, i think instead of making this be the tool to do scrolling and stuff, i actually make it moving... (like drag the layer to a position on the image) ok, quick commit first!

right, we also need to work on layer optimizations! (a lot of layers slows everything down, should probably precalculate stuff when switching layers) (but first, moving the image!) ok, i though of approaching this idea in a lot of ways, but im not sure if this is the best way, but lets test it! ok, after a couple fixes, seems to be working! now, lets make it work for layer masks

ok, redid a lot of parts of it, it should support layer masks now! ok, quick commit!

ok, along with layer optimizations, we also need it to be more clear to the user if they are editing the layer or the layer mask! ok, my first approach was to have the code automatically switch between regular and "many many layers uh oh" mode, but i think theres a better way to do it (time to undo all changes!)

ok, this better way is to do all the small segment processing everytime a layer is changed, and to basically have a list of 48 lists of 2 layers that the regions can use, one layer for everything above in that region, one layer for everything below in that region, and we should only regenerate all these things when layers are moved up and down (the current layer will be calculated by region, shouldn't be pre-calculated) ok, now time to actually code this

ok, should be ready? testing now! ok yep, a lot of things are broken

ok, im rethinking a lot of my choices, and i think this was a bad idea... it may have been smarter to just calcualte the giant image every time the layer order is changed or a layer is added or a layer is selected... ok, things are VERY broken, this is not good.

ok, we here have escaped this alternate timeline and have reverted that cursed commit, thankfully, git allows us to time travel, so welcome to the alternate timeline! in this timeline, the garbage idea didnt happened, so thats nice...
