# 8/12/2024 - 22nd Update!

ok, if done correctly today will be an insane coding day (i have planned 6 hours of coding in my schedule for today, lets see how that goes...) what are we doing today?

> - 8/11/2024 - DONE - more saving and loading work
> - 8/12/2024 - finish things, a couple extra buttons, possible release!

oh right, we need to finish resizing! (just appreciating the 60+ FPS for a second...) also, i think that the text boxes should have a bit of an upgrade (its pretty hard to tell if youre editing them)

its looking a bit fancy...

ok, positioned it, think thats good! now time to make it work! its working! yes, there i do know that there is an issue of typing letters into text boxes and crashing it... (also, it doesnt work the other way yet) ok, that issue has been fixed! 

ok, im back, time to make the resize button resize! (it currently only has funny numbers!) i am currently considering to remake the init function/methoed in order to make it easier to reset? im not sure... probably wont be neccesary for now... ok, `tickButtons()` is now a thing, just for organization! ok, just added another optional parameter to initiating the interface, where layer data can be saved or reset... ok, wrote some code, time to test! so clicking the button doesnt do anything... huh. hey its resizing now! ok, just to test that it hasnt broken the layers system

interesting, we've split the image into two...

![what](</updatelogs/images/082024/08122024 - 2.png>)

ok, will defintely add rendering small images to the list of weird stuff... resizing seems to be working, time to work on finishing the move button stuff! hmm, i think instead of making this be the tool to do scrolling and stuff, i actually make it moving... (like drag the layer to a position on the image) ok, quick commit first!

right, we also need to work on layer optimizations! (a lot of layers slows everything down, should probably precalculate stuff when switching layers) (but first, moving the image!) ok, i though of approaching this idea in a lot of ways, but im not sure if this is the best way, but lets test it! ok, after a couple fixes, seems to be working! now, lets make it work for layer masks

ok, redid a lot of parts of it, it should support layer masks now! ok, quick commit!

ok, along with layer optimizations, we also need it to be more clear to the user if they are editing the layer or the layer mask! ok, my first approach was to have the code automatically switch between regular and "many many layers uh oh" mode, but i think theres a better way to do it (time to undo all changes!)

ok, this better way is to do all the small segment processing everytime a layer is changed, and to basically have a list of 48 lists of 2 layers that the regions can use, one layer for everything above in that region, one layer for everything below in that region, and we should only regenerate all these things when layers are moved up and down (the current layer will be calculated by region, shouldn't be pre-calculated) ok, now time to actually code this

ok, should be ready? testing now! ok yep, a lot of things are broken

ok, im rethinking a lot of my choices, and i think this was a bad idea... it may have been smarter to just calcualte the giant image every time the layer order is changed or a layer is added or a layer is selected... ok, things are VERY broken, this is not good.

ok, we here have escaped this alternate timeline and have reverted that cursed commit, thankfully, git allows us to time travel, so welcome to the alternate timeline! in this timeline, the garbage idea didnt happened, so thats nice...

ok, the idea is creeping back, but this time lets do it properly. calculating that giant image would infact not be the best idea, but this time, lets do this properly. instead of making this a seperate system, it should get calculated along with it, just to speed things up (hopefully). ok, attempt 2 at optimizations, lets not have to revert these changes...

ok, so recalcuating below and above layers should only happen when: all regions are scheduled, or when layer changes occur... ok! things should be working! now, i dont know if its faster or slower, but in theory, it should be faster! zooming in and out takes longer with more layers (as expected, thats where all the original layer "stacking" is now happening) and drawing happens at some decent FPS! now, there is something annoying, which is the fact that the pen/tool path doesnt always connect with itself (until the occasional 5 second full screen updates), which is a bit annoying, so let me try to quickly fix that...

ok turns out, idk how to fix that... yeah. oops, uh, i dont even know why it happens... ok, now for some quality to life changes, we should add simple and straight forward keybinds! (like press e for eraser sort of thing) ok, things have been fixed, and the keybinds work! (yes, i did forget to detect the lowercase keys at first)

ok, i think we should bug test, then prepare for a release! oh right! just remembered, i need to do making "am i editing a layer mask or layer?" more obvious!

hey, look at `interface.py`!

![o](</updatelogs/images/082024/08122024 - 3.png>)

hey, 1000+ lines in that file! ok, so now theres an outline for it! i also moved the layer name text box over! ok, lots of work, quick commit, a release seems near! ok, time to prepare for release v1.0.0! ok, we need docs and a manual! ok, just finished writing the code guide and manual! also, wrote some checks in `checks.py`! ok, seems ready to move to the releases branch and start cleaning up!

wow, did some research, protoplop has more lines than tape, and was done in half the time! (although, to be fair, protoplop's rendering system and interacting system was based off of tape) ok, time to head over to github and make a release! this also means i have to draw something again for the showcase video... uh...

ok, release is ready, but we need a video, and turns out i forgot to edit the readme.md, ok, just updated! we can't have the real release until we get the art done, which will take time some other day... (i'll probably do it tommorow morning!)

oh wow already found a bug, should be fixed now? ok, it was some issue with the brush, should be good now! also, just fixed the issue where when creating a new layer, everything just randomly disappears until changing zoom, turns out i forgot this little part from above (line 40) 

> "or when layer changes occur..." 

oh...

ok, im not finding anymore, i think thats it for me tonight! so, how was today? i got 5 hours of logged coding time, and around 6.25 hours of scheduled coding time! (thats good!) anyways, tommorow will be drawing day, probably will find some bugs like that (please not while im drawing!), so good night!
