ok, if done correctly today will be an insane coding day (i have planned 6 hours of coding in my schedule for today, lets see how that goes...) what are we doing today?

oh right, we need to finish resizing! (just appreciating the 60+ FPS for a second...) also, i think that the text boxes should have a bit of an upgrade (its pretty hard to tell if youre editing them)

its looking a bit fancy...

ok, positioned it, think thats good! now time to make it work! its working! yes, there i do know that there is an issue of typing letters into text boxes and crashing it... (also, it doesnt work the other way yet) ok, that issue has been fixed!
