# 8/8/2024 - 18th Update!

guess what, layers again!

thats the stuff we need to do, lets get to it! so basically, if i think about, all we need to do is find a way to make the user edit the alpha channel (that makes sense and is epreferably easy for me to do) new function/methoed, `grabAlpha()`! it works!

ok, just laid on bed for a second, i think i got an idea of how to do this. instead of directly editing the alpha channel, we have a second array/list of "alpha channels" that are more like layer masks. anyways, these layer masks are translated to an scale of 0-1, which is multiplied by the actual layer's alpha channel, which then is put into a cache "preprocesss for efficiency" list. on deafult, they dont have this layer mask (well, more like its all white or 100 or 1), so itll have an empty string so we can skip having to caclulate the applied layer mask. then, we use this cache for display! 

wow, managed to catch a bug before it happened! (properties were not being shifted upon layer creation or deletion)

wrote another version of placeover but for masks, not sure if itll work

ok, most logic should be added, but theres no way to test just yet... quick commit in case i accidentally delete something (this is a big update)
