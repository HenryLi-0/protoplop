# 8/11/2024 - 21st Update!

ok, finishing up saving! we need that save button! i love opening music streaming apps! i just opened it and an ad started playing! thanks! 3 ads... 4? really? ok finally, time to get to work! `ButtonPushVisualObject` has been turned into `TextButtonPushVisualObject`! button is now working! now, time to sneak back to Tape and copy some of that file saving code... ok, added the image file formats and actually saving to a location, lets connect it up and test it out!

hold up, i got a silly idea

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/082024/08112024 - 1.png>)

they said no D:

i just realized something, we never remove the old visual objects that are no longer used, which means, i believe we are wasting memory? theres no reason they should still exist when they will never be used again... 

aw, not first try... bug fixing time! ok ok, it went through, lets see the results...

![yay!](</updatelogs/images/082024/08112024 - 2.png>)

ok, so turns out we actually did remove old visual objects! whoops!

now, time for our silly custom file extension! ok, why are all file extensions that i thought of taken? i guess we're gonna do `*.protoplop`... ok, the checkbox now makes the save thingy (png and "normal" files, or protoplop file), act differently depending on the "flatten" checkbox! quick commit!

ok, im back! time to finish up with saving to `*.protoplop`! as always, lets take some inspiration from Tape! ok, so copied over `bay.py`, but im gonna remove all the cache stuff, just the stuff needed for import and export! its clean up now!

ok, things should now be converted to a .npy binary data before being saved into the file? time to test this... well, somethings broken! time to fix stuff! wait a minute, it actually saved, but it crashed afterwards...

oh...

45 MB file... ok, a smarter way is possible converting it into .PNG, and saving that raw data? ok, time to go outside and touch grass, ill be right back. ok, im back, i got a mosquito bite, im never going outside again.

ok, testing changes! oops forgot to change the methoed the code referenced, did it again oops... yoo it saved? and no crash? not bad! 262 KB!

ok, time to work on importing! just drew the import icon! time to go back to Tape for inspiration! ok, actually, before i continue, i should probably commit...

im back! ok, lets get back to work on importing/opening! ok, wrote some code, time to test it! oh, problem: the open button isnt connected to anything so it doesnt do anything... ok, moment of truth... YES! recovered the image i drew from earlier! ok, we still have a bit of a problem, we do need to make the code adapt to images with different image sizes... (ex. opening a smaller image) also, we dont even have opening image files just yet... one second...

hey, its working! just opened a png file from one of these updatelog images!

![woo!](</updatelogs/images/082024/08112024 - 4.png>)
