# 8/11/2024 - 21st Update!

ok, finishing up saving! we need that save button! i love opening music streaming apps! i just opened it and an ad started playing! thanks! 3 ads... 4? really? ok finally, time to get to work! `ButtonPushVisualObject` has been turned into `TextButtonPushVisualObject`! button is now working! now, time to sneak back to Tape and copy some of that file saving code... ok, added the image file formats and actually saving to a location, lets connect it up and test it out!

hold up, i got a silly idea

they said no D:

i just realized something, we never remove the old visual objects that are no longer used, which means, i believe we are wasting memory? theres no reason they should still exist when they will never be used again... 

aw, not first try... bug fixing time! ok ok, it went through, lets see the results...

![yay!](</updatelogs/images/082024/08112024 - 2.png>)

ok, so turns out we actually did remove old visual objects! whoops!

now, time for our silly custom file extension! ok, why are all file extensions that i thought of taken? i guess we're gonna do `*.protoplop`... ok, the checkbox now makes the save thingy (png and "normal" files, or protoplop file), act differently depending on the "flatten" checkbox! quick commit!
