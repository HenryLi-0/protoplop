hmm, so today we need to work on color picking, and MORE SCREEN OPTIMIZING!!!

first thing, i guess improving screen region updating? currently it goes right down from top left, but it gets sent back everytime it gets reset, or it can go in a random order. therefore, we should probably make a better system for this...

ok, theres a better system, where we only add regions if they arent already in the udpating queue. that way, everything should try to get as updated as they can! now, time for updating regions that a brush influences...

hmm, somethings broken... ok, its a while later, and ill let you guess whats wrong:

hint: one is x and one it y.

ok, it seems that thats working now!

found a little issue, brush isnt regenerated after color picking. that's been fixed! for some reason, color picking isnt working (it always chooses black) however, ive done a lot of work already, so a quick commit!
