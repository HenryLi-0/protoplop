ok, last full month of summer, lets make this count! yes, my breakfast consisted of one singular lightly salted pistachio (i was about to be late oops). anyways, while i still have energy to stay alive, lets continue coding! but first, ~~a word from our sponsers~~ lets review where we are in the schedule:

hmm, so today we need to work on color picking, and MORE SCREEN OPTIMIZING!!!

first thing, i guess improving screen region updating? currently it goes right down from top left, but it gets sent back everytime it gets reset, or it can go in a random order. therefore, we should probably make a better system for this...

ok, theres a better system, where we only add regions if they arent already in the udpating queue. that way, everything should try to get as updated as they can! now, time for updating regions that a brush influences...

hmm, somethings broken... ok, its a while later, and ill let you guess whats wrong:

![silly](</updatelogs/images/082024/08012024 - 1.png>)

hint: one is x and one it y.

ok, it seems that thats working now!

found a little issue, brush isnt regenerated after color picking. that's been fixed! for some reason, color picking isnt working (it always chooses black) however, ive done a lot of work already, so a quick commit!

oh right, we still have the issue of `SKETCH_QUALITY`... uh...

anyways, painting and color picking time! ok, fixed a little thing where the starting number of the slider was 2 instead of 1... ok, wrote a `ColorVisualObject` visual object! took a little debugging, but its working! is so good that you can even move it (you should not be able to) unfortuantely, working on the color system means we will have to hide our console, just kidding, adding a butotn that gives access to it!

![its still here!](</updatelogs/images/082024/08012024 - 2.png>)

somethings a little wrong with how the icon looks, but i should probably start working on color picking... ok, should be centered, only thing left is actual color picking! (like the rainbow image thingy, maybe also give it text based?) quick commit!

ok, its 11:45 PM at night, i dont think i can continue work because there is a creepy insect flying around this area and im terrified, and im probably gonna be told to go to sleep. anyways, unfortunately wasnt able to continue work because of some garbage HTML widget and user permissions thing (i did spend two hours on a futile attempt to modify the code through modifying the copy and pasting data). not only did this destroy my schedule for tonight, it will also destroy my schedule tommorow. hopefully i wake up earlier... anyways, good night!
