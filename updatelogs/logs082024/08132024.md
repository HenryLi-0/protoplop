# 8/13/2024 - 23rd Update!

ok, today is gonna be the release day! (ive been procrastinating this all day) unfortunately, i do not trust my art skills to draw a banner, so its gonna have a similar one to Tape, just a part of some image that i think looks good! now, time to make a video...


how do you zoom in on this camera's video... yes, im actually gonna use a physcial camera too! i love finding a bug in the middle of the demo (yes it crashed me in the middle of drawing) 28 minutes of drawing, time to film the rest of the video... 

ok, finished drawing and filming! editing time! ok, footage is uploading, time for editing! (yes, i also fixed a bug just now! flattening image wasnt taking in account the state of whether or not an image is visible!) 1 GB of footage... uh oh. comes in handy i edited videos for two years ig... spent 5 minutes editing 19 seconds! i love editing! 

i dont like editing... its been an hour, and yes, im still editing D:

finally done editing at 2 minute 47 seconds video! only took 2 hours for filming and editing! cant wait to wait half an hour for it to render and upload!
