# 8/5/2024 - 15th Update!

todays going to be a busy day... (of course, by that i mean outside of programming)

> -  8/5/2024 - finish up layers

ok, lets continue! so, apparently going at 60 FPS and the new typing detection system does kinda break the textbox editing system... ok its been fixed! working on layer selection now!

```
0+50*i-self.layersOffset=y
50*i=y+self.layersOffset
i = (y+self.layersOffset)/50
```

clicking on layers and editing their names are working!

ok, henry asked two artists (that also have expired school licenses for the drawing app) (wait why am i talking in third person? anyways...), i have gathered the information that layers need:
- transparency/alpha channel editing (in layer form)
- hiding and showing
- ~~folders~~ (im gonna act like i didnt hear that)
- the "my transparency channel is the existance of the lower layer!"
- the obvious, moving up and down, renaming, deleting, creating
- locking!!!

icon drawing time... ok, drew hiding and showing, and also locked and unlocked! gotta admit, the "visible"/"shown" icon (of the eye) looks weird/isnt the best thing ive drawn, but itll do for now. we also have `DoubleIconVisualObject` which is a new visual object thats basically an icon and button, where there is an image for both on and off (but it does the icon outline work for you!)

ok, jokes on you, its called `ToggleVisualObject` now, i'll let my docs explain: "A toggle, basically a fancy button/icon, but this time with two faces, on and off that switch on rising detection of clicks!" ok, its working! quick commit...
