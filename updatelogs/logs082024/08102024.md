# 8/10/2024 - 20th Update!

ok, time to implement the paint bucket! right, forgot to mention, i finally setup a `.gitignore` yesterday! ok, its been copied over to `render.py` and docs have been added! now adding it to `interface.py`... ok, its working! however, i do need the data popup to appear so that we can modify tolerance... also, im gonna act like that 5 seconds of freezing the program didnt happen! wow, just filled the background with (0,0,0,0)...

uh, we may need optimizations...

![uh oh](</updatelogs/images/082024/08102024 - 1.png>)

anyways, the data popup window is working now!

ok time to get onto the actual assigned work of today!

> - 8/10/2024 - even more aditional features (keybinds, saving, loading)

oh

~~icon drawing time!~~ ok, saving icon drawn (again ig)! ok, update, you can now hover over icons in the tool area to see what they are! also, the save icons and console has been moved to the right side. yes, i am aware that it is not nicely/perfectly aligned. i am also a bit upset. 

ok, was thinking for a bit, and i want to have saving be a data pop up (i am silly). basically, it will provide options for saving, since, one data type and the windows popup save screen is logical and lame (it would be the better choice here, but whatever) now, introducing, the newest visual object in town, a checkbox! basically a simple toggle! we can click it! ok, ill finish this up later!
