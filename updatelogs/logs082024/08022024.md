# 8/2/2024 - 12th Update!

oh look, i got up earlier! its currently 6AM right now! ok, so first things first, color picker! 

ok, i looked at color picker and i have an idea. it appears that the bars can be actually easy to code given as HSV, where a seperate bar is Hue and Saturation is the x axis and Value is the y axis. this means that i should be able to just use an image of a genereated color that uses mouse position to calculate Saturation and Value and a slider to control Hue. Finally we can easily convert to RGB. However, we also love transparency, as in the alpha channel, so we should probably have a second slider for that

ok, thats generating and we have vertical sliders now! also, what are they playing on the radio...

hey, something crazy, the math for the sliders appear to work backwards (high to low)... this is good but wasnt made with that in mind! ok, sliders properly aligned! ok, its been a bit of debugging, but it updates now!

ok, quick commit!
