# 8/2/2024 - 12th Update!

oh look, i got up earlier! its currently 6AM right now! ok, so first things first, color picker! 

ok, i looked at color picker and i have an idea. it appears that the bars can be actually easy to code given as HSV, where a seperate bar is Hue and Saturation is the x axis and Value is the y axis. this means that i should be able to just use an image of a genereated color that uses mouse position to calculate Saturation and Value and a slider to control Hue. Finally we can easily convert to RGB. However, we also love transparency, as in the alpha channel, so we should probably have a second slider for that

ok, thats generating and we have vertical sliders now! also, what are they playing on the radio...

hey, something crazy, the math for the sliders appear to work backwards (high to low)... this is good but wasnt made with that in mind! ok, sliders properly aligned! ok, its been a bit of debugging, but it updates now!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/082024/08022024 - 1.png>)

ok, quick commit!

so i did a couple edits here and there and edited `keepInFrame()` has been upgraded! instead of being `def keepInFrame(self, maxX, maxY)`, we have `def keepInFrame(self, minX, minY, maxX, maxY)`! this should remove the need for doing "silly silly offset" that i remember from tramatic events from making the graph UI in Tape.

also, since line 10 if `interface.py` that imports all the visual objects looks like this: `from subsystems.visuals import OrbVisualObject, ButtonVisualObject, EditableTextBoxVisualObject, DummyVisualObject, IconVisualObject, HorizontalSliderVisualObject, ColorVisualObject, VerticalSliderVisualObject`, i think its smarter to just import it all...

also, very fancy rainbow thingy behind the hue slider!

ok, back to work on the `MovableColorVisualObject`. ok, added connecting stuff, yay, bug fixing time...

oh right! its broken because we dont even precalculate the layers anymore! (i dont think its neccesary with the other optimizations? maybe in the future...)

hey, we're color picking but the UI is cursed!

![weird UI](</updatelogs/images/082024/08022024 - 3.png>)

ok, its 10:57 PM, time to get coding! "finish color picking and start color picking" i love calling two features the same thing...

ok, color picking is working! however, i seem to have made changes today that have caused the pop up data menu to no longer appear?

![oh my](</updatelogs/images/082024/08022024 - 4.png>)

oh my, somethings not quite right there, it seems... ok, fixed! color picking is done, time to start color picking! the color picker grid seems to work, but the colors are a bit off (top right does not set it to the strongest color) (a long while later...) oh i know the issue, its to do with transparency being calculated in when it shouldnt

this is kinda cursed, the behavior changes every time i run it (theres no random.random!) ok, its working now! accidentally deleted a line of calculations which messed it up a little, but glad i caught that earlier than never! (it did take way too long for me to catch that mistake, but you know what they say, better late then never!) anyways, ignoring the strange boost of optimism, i think thats it for today! im gonna end the log here, but i'll play around with the system to look for any bugs! (none has appeared yet, and hopefully none do!) anyways, good night!
