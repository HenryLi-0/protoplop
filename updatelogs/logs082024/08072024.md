# 8/7/2024 - 17th Update!

ok, its the afternoon, what are we doing today?

> - 8/7/2024 - additional features (pencil, eraser, paint bucket)

oh, ok! maybe i'll do pencil first (because its the easiest) ok fixed those random lines, and also fixed some color picking issue with the pencil! eraser time! (also i have no idea how i will do paint bucket) unrelated side note, i can hear every individual instrument in this song with headphones! thats crazy! looking at the placeOver code, do we already have support for adding negative arrays? currently testing to see if it actuall supports as it seems like my attempt didnt work as expected... aw looks like it doesnt...

oh right, we get an overflow because numpy.uint8 doesnt support negatives? still isnt working... oh, we were subtracting negative numbers and overflow errors, thats the problem...

ok, still broken, gonna quickly commit
