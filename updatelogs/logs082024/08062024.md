# 8/6/2024 - 16th Update!

better finish layers UI...

got a silly idea, give it a second... yay! we can put in lamdas to the toggle visual object that activate when it turns off/on! ok got the headphones working, let me play some music before i fall asleep. ok, some code concept thinking (essentially me talking outloud)

```
'''Same order/conncetion in order to self.layers self.layerNames'''
self.layerProperties = 
[
    [locked (boolean), visible (boolean), transparency layer (numpy.ndarray)],
    [locked (boolean), visible (boolean), transparency layer (numpy.ndarray)],
    [locked (boolean), visible (boolean), transparency layer (numpy.ndarray)]
]

'''With deafult as:'''
[False, True, (all white array)]
```

ok some logic should have been added, but its probably important to make the buttons work first... ok, showing and hiding a layer works! ok, the little icons appearing depending on the state has been added! (i should probably switch the show/hide thing of the icon to reflect the current state)

ok, now you cant draw on locked or hidden layers! quick commit...

time for creating and destroying layers!

oops, got distracted, here's some fancy indicating things! wait a minute, are the icons offset? ok, its been fixed, along with possibly the loading order of the screen? (now, if a region update is requested, it removes the region if it is there, then adds the region to the back of the requests)

![very fancy](</updatelogs/images/082024/08062024 - 1.png>)

before working on icons, one final sledgehammer in settings time

ok, sledgehammer complete, back to work! creating and deleted layer keybinds have been added (alt + a for create, alt + s for delete)! ok, we need to add keybind cooldowns (just created 20 layers on accident...) ok, a 0.2 second cooldown for keybinds have been added! ok, added the fancy feature of it (creating based on mouse position when in the area)

its a little later, and i added mouse scrolling into the box, time for buttons... ok, the new layer button is good, but the delete layer button is a little wonky... i think i know whats happening here, my guess is that the name text box is setting the name to the old one because it doesnt realize the order has changed! ok, issue fixed, and that was indeed the reason!

ok, so now (for layer related things) we have these things left:
- transparency/alpha channel editing (in layer form)
- ~~folders~~ (im gonna act like i didnt hear that)
- the "my transparency channel is the existance of the lower layer!"

so uh, i should probably take a break from layers... updated schedule (hopefully i dont need to add any more days for layers)
