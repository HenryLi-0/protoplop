# 8/6/2024 - 16th Update!

better finish layers UI...

got a silly idea, give it a second... yay! we can put in lamdas to the toggle visual object that activate when it turns off/on! ok got the headphones working, let me play some music before i fall asleep. ok, some code concept thinking (essentially me talking outloud)

```
'''Same order/conncetion in order to self.layers self.layerNames'''
self.layerProperties = 
[
    [locked (boolean), visible (boolean), transparency layer (numpy.ndarray)],
    [locked (boolean), visible (boolean), transparency layer (numpy.ndarray)],
    [locked (boolean), visible (boolean), transparency layer (numpy.ndarray)]
]

'''With deafult as:'''
[False, True, (all white array)]
```

ok some logic should have been added, but its probably important to make the buttons work first... ok, showing and hiding a layer works! ok, the little icons appearing depending on the state has been added! (i should probably switch the show/hide thing of the icon to reflect the current state)

ok, now you cant draw on locked or hidden layers! quick commit...
