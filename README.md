# Protoplop

a totally original drawing idea

## Note:

Protoplop just had its first (real) release!

## Goal:

Issue: My school license for a drawing app has expired

**Normal Solution:** Find a new drawing app and use it

**My Solution:** Decide to make your own drawing tool

One option is clearly better here, you decide which... (clearly the second one) (joke) (not really)

Ok, time to get started!

You can also find a video of it working [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBlHhliIzMU)

### Getting Started:

First, make sure you installed all the neccesary python modules! (Any modules that don't come with python are listened down below!) Next, either clone this repository, or get the latest release from the releases tab, and run [`main.py`](/main.py)! Check [`MANUAL.md`](/MANUAL.md) for some tips of how to use this, and check [`CODEGUIDE.md`](/CODEGUIDE.md) if you're interested in the code!

### Modules Used (that dont come with python):
- numpy
- PIL (Pillow)
