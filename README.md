# protoslop

a totally original drawing idea

## Note:

Protoslop (yes, it stand for something silly) is still under development and is planned to have a (hopefully) test release before the end of July (if not july, hopefully by the end of august...)! Unfortunately, contributions are not being accepted until it has an actual ready release (it is still in its very early stages and i do frequently get ideas at 1 AM) and is suitable for testing. However, don't hesitate to report any bugs! 

(Note: As of mid to late July 2024, everything is very likely broken)

## Goal:

Issue: My school license for a drawing app has expired

**Normal Solution:** Find a new drawing app and use it

**My Solution:** Decide to make a drawing tool

One option is clearly better here, you decide which... (clearly the second one) (joke) (not really)

Ok, time to get started!

### A couple things to do:

- ???

### Modules Used (that dont come with python):
- numpy
- PIL (Pillow)
